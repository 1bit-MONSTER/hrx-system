// CTS-only reader of contiguous native XDNA ELF fixtures. The format and load,
// binding and invocation rules are derived from runtime/src/iree/schemas/
// xdna_executable.{h,c}, runtime/src/iree/hal/drivers/amd/xdna/image/ and
// experimental/xdna/executable.c. This reader has no dependency on those
// implementations.
//
// The admitted subset is ELF32LE EM_AIE, AIE2P flags 3, metadata version 2 and
// transaction encoding 0.1: one mutable COMMAND allocation, one allocation
// use, one entry, no static relocations and three GLOBAL buffers. Each buffer
// has a 64-byte minimum extent, four-byte alignment, zero logical offset and
// DEVICE_VISIBLE | COHERENT usage; access is READ, READ, WRITE respectively.
// Dynamic relocations are declared eight-byte SHIM_ADDRESS fields. Load ranges
// may alias source bytes and have explicit zero-fill tails. Only invocation
// zero, which establishes the program's state, is exposed.
//
// Profile revision and firmware ABI IDs come from the compiler's NPU2 target
// contract keyed by exact endpoint architecture and target ID. They are not
// firmware-version facts reported by device_query_info. Admission checks the
// available native geometry and instruction constraints separately. Neither
// ELF admission nor command completion certifies worker termination; the
// fixture's compiled program must satisfy that native submission contract.
