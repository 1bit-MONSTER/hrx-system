// Retained source-to-Low lowering plans.
//
// Source planning runs after target legality and before target-Low IR
// construction. It selects one rule, descriptor-matrix row, or target callback
// plan for each non-structural source operation in traversal order. A backward
// demand walk then marks every source value needed by emission and elides pure
// plans whose results have no materialized use. The retained plan is immutable
// during emission except for its monotonic consumption cursor.
